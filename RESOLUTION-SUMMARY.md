# Aditya Hospital - Deployment Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary

The PM2 logs show repeated errors:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/root/adityahospital/server/dist/public/index.html'
```

This indicates that the Node.js server is trying to serve static files from the `dist/public` directory, but this directory either doesn't exist or doesn't contain the built React frontend files.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Missing Build Process**: The frontend React application hasn't been built, so the `dist/public` directory is missing or empty
2. **Incorrect Path Configuration**: The server expects built files in a specific location based on the Vite configuration
3. **Incomplete Deployment**: Previous deployment attempts may have failed during the build process

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Fixed Deployment Script (`fix-deployment.sh`)

A comprehensive deployment script that:
- Cleans previous builds
- Installs all dependencies correctly for both server and client
- Builds the frontend properly using Vite
- Verifies the build output
- Initializes the database

### 2. Created Fixed PM2 Configuration (`ecosystem.config.fixed.js`)

Updated PM2 configuration with:
- Correct working directory
- Proper environment variables for production
- Appropriate host settings

### 3. Created Diagnostic Tool (`diagnose-build.js`)

A Node.js script to verify:
- Existence of build directory
- Presence of required files (especially index.html)
- File sizes and content

### 4. Updated Documentation

Enhanced deployment guides with:
- Specific troubleshooting steps for ENOENT errors
- Instructions for using the fixed deployment script
- Verification procedures

## How to Fix the Issue

1. **Run the Fixed Deployment Script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x fix-deployment.sh
   ./fix-deployment.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Build Output**:
   ```bash
   node diagnose-build.js
   ```

3. **Update PM2 Configuration** (if needed):
   ```bash
   cp ecosystem.config.fixed.js ecosystem.config.js
   ```

4. **Restart the Application**:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js --env production
   ```

## Prevention for Future Deployments

1. Always use the provided deployment scripts rather than manual steps
2. Verify build output before starting the application
3. Monitor logs after deployment to catch issues early
4. Keep backup of working configuration files
